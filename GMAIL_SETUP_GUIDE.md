# Gmail SMTP Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Gmail SMTP for sending emails from your Unidirectional Communication System using Nodemailer.

## ðŸ“§ Why Gmail SMTP?

- **Free**: No cost for sending emails
- **Reliable**: Google's infrastructure
- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration
- **High Limits**: 500 emails/day for free accounts
- **No AWS Complexity**: No need for SES verification

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. **Go to Google Account Settings:**

   - Visit [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)
   - Sign in with your Gmail account

2. **Navigate to Security:**

   - Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
   - Look for "2-Step Verification"

3. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**
   - Click "Get started"
   - Follow the setup process
   - You'll need a phone number for verification

### Step 2: Generate App Password

1. **Go to App Passwords:**

   - In Google Account > Security
   - Look for "App passwords" (you'll only see this if 2FA is enabled)
   - Click "App passwords"

2. **Create New App Password:**

   - Select "Mail" from the dropdown
   - Click "Generate"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (you won't see it again!)

3. **Save the Password:**
   - This password is different from your regular Gmail password
   - Use this in your `.env` file as `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`

### Step 3: Configure Your Application

1. **Update your `.env` file:**

   ```env
   GMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

2. **Example:**
   ```env
   GMAIL_USER=john.doe@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
   ```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Security Considerations

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to version control
- **Use App Passwords** instead of your regular password
- **Keep App Passwords secure** - they provide full access to your Gmail

### Gmail Limits

- **Free Accounts**: 500 emails/day
- **Paid Accounts**: 2,000 emails/day
- **Rate Limiting**: Gmail may throttle if you send too many emails quickly

### Troubleshooting

#### "Invalid Login" Error

- **Check 2FA**: Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
- **Check App Password**: Verify you're using the App Password, not your regular password
- **Check Username**: Ensure `GMAIL_USER` is your full email address

#### "Less Secure Apps" Error

- **Use App Passwords**: Don't use "Less secure app access"
- **Enable 2FA**: This is required for App Passwords

#### "Quota Exceeded" Error

- **Check Daily Limit**: You may have hit the 500 emails/day limit
- **Wait 24 Hours**: Limits reset daily
- **Consider Paid Account**: For higher limits

## ðŸ”„ Alternative Email Services

If Gmail doesn't work for you, here are alternatives:

### 1. Outlook/Hotmail SMTP

```env
# In your .env file
EMAIL_SERVICE=outlook
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### 2. Yahoo SMTP

```env
# In your .env file
EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### 3. Custom SMTP Server

```env
# For other providers
SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Email Functionality

### 1. Test Backend Connection

```bash
curl http://your-domain.com/api/test
```

### 2. Test Scheduler (Sends Emails)

```bash
curl http://your-domain.com/api/test-scheduler
```

### 3. Test Email Manually

1. Register a Type A user
2. Register a Type B user
3. Create a request (Type A)
4. Accept the request (Type B)
5. Send a message (Type A)
6. Check if Type B receives reminder emails
